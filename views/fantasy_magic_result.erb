    <p>Once upon a time in the mystical land of <strong><%= @magical_land %></strong>, there lived a <strong><%= @adj_one %></strong> wizard named <strong><%= @wiz %></strong>. This wizard was known throughout the land for their <strong><%= @adj_two %></strong> spells and their loyal <strong><%= @creature %></strong> companion.</p>

    <p>One day, the wizard received an urgent letter from Queen <strong><%= @queen %></strong>, begging for help. An evil sorcerer named <strong><%= @villian %></strong> had stolen the enchanted grimoire, which was the source of all magic in the land.</p>

    <p>Determined to restore balance, <strong><%= @wiz %></strong> and his trusted <strong><%= @creature %></strong> set off on a <strong><%= @adj_three %></strong> journey. Armed with their trusty <strong><%= @tool %></strong> and a potion of <strong><%= @noun_one %></strong>, they traveled through the <strong><%= @adj_four %></strong> Forest, where the trees whispered secrets of the ancient spells.</p>

    <p>Along the way, the wizard encountered a <strong><%= @adj_five %></strong> sphinx guarding a great wide river, who offered a riddle: "I'm not a blanket, yet I cover the ground; a crystal from heaven that doesn't make a sound. What am I?"</p>

    <!-- Insert a pop-up with the answer (snowflake). Insert a pop-up with a hint -->

    <p><strong><%= @wiz %></strong> solved the riddle, allowing them to continue their quest. Further into the Forest, close to <strong><%= @villian %></strong>'s lair, they encountered a <strong><%= @adj_six %></strong> wall. It must have been <strong><%= @number %></strong><strong><%= @unit %></strong> tall, and as wide as the eye could see.  <strong><%= @wiz %></strong>'s <strong><%= @creature %></strong> <strong><%= @verb %></strong> <strong><%= @prep %></strong> the wall and help the wizard to get over the wall.</p>

    <p>Finally, the wizard reached <strong><%= @villian %></strong>'s lair. In an epic showdown, the wizard and <strong><%= @villian %></strong> dueled for posession of the grimoire.  As spells flew across the room, bolts of <strong><%= @color_one %></strong> and <strong><%= @noun_two %></strong> were everywhere.  At one point a spell ricochetted off of the <strong><%= @object_one %></strong> in the corner, turning the <strong><%= @creature %></strong> into a <strong><%= @object_two %></strong>.  Upon seeing this, <strong><%= @wiz %></strong> used a powerful spell of <strong><%= @emotion %></strong>, to defeat <strong><%= @villian %></strong> and reclaim the grimoire. </p>

    <p>]While the grimoire held no answers towards helping transform the <strong><%= @creature %></strong> back, perhaps the magic potion would help. <strong><%= @wiz %></strong> poured the <strong><%= @noun_one %></strong> over the <strong><%= @object_two %></strong>.  The <strong><%= @object_two %></strong> began to shake and glow <strong><%= @color_two %></strong>.  With a loud <strong><%= @sound %></strong>, it transformed back in to a <strong><%= @creature %></strong>. Together they returned to Queen <strong><%= @queen %></strong> and peace was restored to <strong><%= @magical_land %></strong>.</p>
